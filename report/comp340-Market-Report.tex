\section{The job market}
This report will review requirements for three different jobs in companies I would like to apply for. From these requirements I will summarize what I have done, or what I will do to meet the goals. 


\subsection{Job Advert One}
Graduate Programmer, Frontier Developments, Cambridge. 
I found that Frontier was hiring from indeed, so I went to their website and found the graduate job roles that I would like to apply for. I figure that they would likely look at the applications that come through from their website rather than applications that come from indeed or other job recruitment sites.

\textbf{Requirements}
Good degree in relevant subject.
 Frontier has a page for programmer guidance, which helps outline what they would like from applicants \cite{FrontierAdvice}.

Some key points from that page are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item CV should be a doc or pdf and clearly show your education and grades attained.
	\item Use work samples to show us what sets you apart from other applicants, and show personal projects, as work from uni courses tend to be similar.
	\item Game jams typically don't give you much time to work with, so also include some bigger projects if possible. Also if any work was done in a group, explain what your role was.
	\item If you have developed games or demos then the easiest way for us to review these is a highlights video hosted online, with voice-over if you want to explain what we're looking at. Screenshots with text is also fine.
	\item Show sample source code via public source control.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Strategy}

Within my website I only highlighted my big projects, especially the projects that I worked on by myself.
Throughout my time at uni, I have checked almost every bit of work I have done into source control, so almost all the code I have done is made available. Furthermore within my website portfolio, I have linked the relevant github repo to that site, so if anyone is curios to how I implemented something, they can easily look.

From this I will create a YouTube channel that contains all the game related work I have done, especially with my own projects that I worked on over the summers at uni.

%Compile insights gathered by interviewing relevant experts and mentors
\section{Insights from experts and mentors}

I contacted one of my old friends, who did a computing degree at Southampton uni, and now is working at Jagex as a big data engineer. 
I contacted him asking some questions in regards to how he feels at his new job and what it is like to work in the industry.

One of his comments about how he heard about the job vacancy was he found it on their website, as he said games companies are highly sort after, and like people with a ``go do it'' attitude.
From that I will start looking at game company websites that I would like to work for, rather than looking on job sites trying to find them.

Another one of his comments stated that he applied for a graduate position, which meaned the company put aside time and resources in order for him to patch the gaps in the knowledge he wasn't taught in university.
