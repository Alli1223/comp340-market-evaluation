\section{Insights from experts and mentors}

I contacted one of my old friends, who did a computing degree at southampton, and now is working at Jagex as a big data engineer. 
I contacted him asking some questions in regards to how he feels at his new job and what it is like to work in the industry.

One of his comments about how he heard about the job vacancy was he found it on their website, as he said games companies are highly sort after, and like people with a ``go do it'' attitude.
From that I will start looking at game company websites that I would like to work for, rather than looking on job sites trying to find them.

Another one of his comments stated that he applied for a graduate position, which meaned the company put aside time and resources in order for him to patch the gaps in the knowledge he wasn't taught in university.
